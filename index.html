            <h1>Silver Love</h1>
            <p>A collaboration with Chino at Black Widow Tattoo, this ring takes its name from Tartarus — the dark underworld of Greek mythology where souls were judged and the wicked received eternal punishment. There may be small differences between the pictured sterling silver piece and its stainless steel counterpart. The steel pieces may have slightly less detail than the handcrafted silver version.</p>

            <h1>Sailors Heaven</h1>

            <h1>Lady in Black</h1>
            <p>Archers were a vital addition to any medieval army, and from high in the turrets, skilled bowmen were often the only hopes of holding off a violent usurping. This ring is for the sharpshooters working to prevent the siege. There may be small differences between the pictured sterling silver piece and its stainless steel counterpart. The steel pieces may have slightly less detail than the handcrafted silver version.</p>
